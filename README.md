Clone this repository and npm install to get all the dependency running.

In order to test the routes,you can use postman 

in  the router to get all the users,this is where we are testing the jwt.Make sure after signup you copy the token

You will only be able to get all users once you have a valid token

In -order to test, copy the token.In header,create an Authorization key and paste your token as the value starting with Bearer.

example==> Authorization  Bearer (your token)

I will later automate the token part.

Good luck..You can also contribute to this repo
